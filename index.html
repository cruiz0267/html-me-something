                <a name="Adam"></a>
                <h3>Adam West</h3>

                <p>The OG of Batman. Adam West played Batman on the popular TV series from 1966 to 1968. The show was known for over the top BLAM and POW images during fight scenes. West is one of the more popular actors to have played the cape crusader. </p>



                <a name="Michael"></a>
                <h3>Michael Keaton</h3>
                <figure>

                </figure>
                <p>Michael Keaton played Batman in two movies Batman (1989) and Batman Returns (1992). He was the first actor to portray Batman on the big screen and did quite a good job at it. It was what some people view as the pinnacle of Keaton's career. His career has made quite a comeback in the last few years.</p>



                <a name="Val"></a>
                <h3>Val Kilmer</h3>
                <figure>

                </figure>
                <p>Val Kilmer played Batman in the 1995 movie Batman Forever. While he certainly isn't the worst actor to don the Batsuit, he won't be remembered as the best. The film did well at the box office but didn't do well with critics. Kilmer was allegedly difficult to deal with and didn't return as Batman.</p>



                <a name="George"></a>
                <h3>George Clooney</h3>
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/george.jpg"/>
                </figure>
                <p>The bat suit had nipples... there isn't a whole lot more to say.</p>



                <a name="Christian"></a>
                <h3>Christian Bale</h3>
                <figure>

                <p>Christian Bale played Batman in the Dark Knight Trilogy from 2005 to 2012. He is one of the most popular actors to take on the Batman role. He is personally my favorite Batman. He brought a new level of depth to the character, much more savage and darker.</p>



                <a name="Ben"></a>
                <h3>Ben Affleck</h3>
                <figure>

                </figure>
                <p>The jury is still out on the Dahhk Knight. He was in Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice (2015) and had a small role in Suicide Squad (2016). He is starring the upcoming Justice League movie and rumor has it a new stand alone Batman movie.</p>



                <a name="Other"></a>
                <h3>Others</h3>

                <p>Many other actors have portrayed Batman in TV shows, cartoons and movies.</p>
